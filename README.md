The Forest
==================

Opening: Player awakes in the middle of a forest, completely isolated from the outside world. In their pocket, Player finds a hexagonal stone slab, with strange symbols carved on it. In front of the player is a small stone alter structure. Player can look, examine alter, examine stone, examine trees, and use stone/alter.

Setting: Dense Forest/Stone Temple. Entrance to the Stone Temple will appear in the Forest, and the Player must make their way through the Temple to escape.

Entities: The only other entities in the game are random objects found in various rooms of the Temple related to puzzle solving, and a mysterious figure described following Player in the background, but cannot be interacted with.

Actions: Look, Walk, Take, Use

Endgame: Upon completing the final puzzle, a large stone door opens and the player walks into a blinding light as the dark figure sprints towards Player.  When the light dies down, Player wakes up next to the stone alter, but the entrance is closed and there is a note in place of the stone slab on the alter. The note thanks Player for helping cage "the Beast" in the temple, and apoligizes for having sent Player in instead of themselves, but they're hands were tied.  The note then tells the way back home and the game ends.
